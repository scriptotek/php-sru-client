## [Unreleased]

(nothing yet)

## [0.7.1] - 2020-07-13

### Changed

- Added request URL to SruErrorException.

## [0.7.0] - 2019-04-03

### Changed
- Update from httplug to PSR-17/PSR-18. With PSR-17 follows the requirement of a HTTP factory implementation.
  Run `composer require http-interop/http-factory-guzzle` to continue using sru-client as before.

- Remove support for PHP 5.6 and 7.0 because we updated the tests to work with PHPUnit 7+
  and can no longer run tests on PHP < 7.1. Also, PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 have now reached end-of-life.

## [0.6.4] - 2019-03-06
### Fixed
- Fix a few type hints.
- Minor code style cleanups.

## [0.6.3] - 2017-08-01
### Added
- Add support for setting custom headers.

### Changed
- Don't throw `ClientErrorException` on 4XX responses, since some servers return 4XX responses whenever there is a diagnostic message, including zero result queries. Diagnostic messages are better handled by our `Response` class.

## [0.6.2] - 2017-08-01
### Added
- Add `__toString()` method to `Record` to allow simple string serialization.

## [0.6.1] - 2017-08-01
### Changed
- Update from quitesimplexmlelement 0.x to 1.x.

## [0.6.0] - 2017-07-01
### Changed
- Replace hard dependency on Guzzle with HTTPlug client discovery.
  To continue use Guzzle, run `composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter`
